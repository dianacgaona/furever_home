heroku login

heroku create (appName) (lol furever-home was already taken)

git remote -v [display remotes]
after the heroku app is created 2 remotes are created.

one for the heroku Fetch Push

one for Github Fetch Push

NOTES:
-Verifying deploy... done.
In the app's Package JSON inside the Scripts object

"scripts": {
"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
"start": "concurrently --kill-others \"cd frontend && npm start\" \"cd backend && npm start\"",
"heroku-postbuild":"cd backend && npm install && cd ../frontend && npm install"
},

Unfortunately, if it is a non-master branch, Heroku won't build it. Example:

\$ git push heroku-dev test
counting objects ...
...
Pushed to non-master branch, skipping build.
To git@heroku.com:example-dev.git

- [new branch] test -> test
  So instead, use the following command to push the non-master branch to Heroku's master branch, so that it will build it:

\$ git push heroku [name-of-your-branch]:master
Once you are ready to push master, then:

git push heroku [name-of-your-branch]:master
